Google Maps is a use case of Graphs.
Autocomplete is a use case of Tries.
Your browser’s Back button? That’s a Stack.
Printing jobs queued up? That’s a Queue.
Tracking unique visitors on a site? That’s a Set.

→ Arrays & Strings
Why: 70% of entry-level questions start here.
Use case: Storing leaderboard scores, search results, text processing.
Learn: Sliding window, prefix sums, two pointers.

→ Stacks & Queues
Why: You need these for problems that involve order, backtracking, or recent state.
Use case: Undo feature in editors (Stack), call center systems (Queue).
Learn: Infix to postfix, balanced brackets, task scheduling.

→ HashMaps & Sets
Why: Constant-time lookups. Essential for optimizing brute force solutions.
Use case: Caching, de-duplication, frequency counters.
Learn: Two sum, anagram groups, longest consecutive sequence.

→ Linked Lists
Why: Pointer manipulation is a common test of your understanding of memory.
Use case: Building LRU caches, managing memory buffers.
Learn: Reverse a list, detect cycle, merge two lists.

→ Trees & BSTs
Why: Teaches recursion + hierarchical data handling.
Use case: File systems, compiler syntax trees, databases.
Learn: Traversals (BFS, DFS), Lowest Common Ancestor, BST insertion/search.

→ Tries
Why: Underused but powerful for text/prefix-based problems.
Use case: Autocomplete systems, spell checkers, search engines.
Learn: Insert/search/delete in Trie, word search.

→ Graphs
Why: Real-world system modeling. Every advanced interview eventually hits this.
Use case: Routing systems, service dependencies, friend suggestions.
Learn: BFS/DFS, Dijkstra’s, cycle detection, topological sort.

→ Heaps (Priority Queues)
Why: Efficient for sorting and finding the top/bottom 'k' items.
Use case: Job schedulers, recommendation engines.
Learn: Kth largest element, merge K sorted lists, sliding window max.
